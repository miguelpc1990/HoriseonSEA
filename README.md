# Horiseon-SEA

## Description
* My motivation for the website was to better learn and practice my HTML/CSS coding practice.
* This project allowed me to work on getting practice with content creation and make a valuable website at the same time.
* This helps others better understand their impact online.
* I learned how to better manage website design and build on inifficient code.

## Instillation
* Download visual studio code or a text editor.
* Pull the code from the repository https://ua.bootcampcontent.com/UA-Coding-Bootcamp/UofA-VIRT-FSF-PT-09-2022-U-LOLC/-/tree/main/01-HTML-Git-CSS/02-Challenge.
* Open the code in visual studio or your text editor.
* You can now change and/or run the code from the editor.
## Usage
* The website is purely information, you can navigate the page by clicking the links on the top right in the navigation pane.
